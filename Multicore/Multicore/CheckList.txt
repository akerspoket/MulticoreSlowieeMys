Iteration 1
	? Generate primary rays from a camera position and orientation.
	? Support camera interaction using keyboard and mouse input.
	? Support ray casting of sphere primitives.
	? Support ray casting of triangle primitives.
	? Support a single point light source.
Iteration 2
	? Support up to 10 moving point lights where each light casts shadows.
	? Support diffuse and specular lighting with light attenuation.
	? Support multiple ray traces/bounces.
Iteration 3 (Grade E)
	? Support ray tracing of one OBJ triangle mesh with at least one texture material attached to it.
	? Performance analysis showing how the following factors affect the performance:
	o Number of threads per thread group.
	o Screen resolution.
	o Trace depth.
	o Number of light sources.
	o Number of triangles.

Additions

To get grade D you have to implement grade E and two of the following additions:
	? Super sampling to hide aliasing artifacts.
	? Scene interaction, for example picking, using GPGPU.
	? One additional light source type.
To get grade C you have to implement grade D and two of the following additions:
	? Normal mapping
	? Particle system with N-body interaction.
	? Multiple diffuse materials per triangle object.
To get grade B you have to implement grade C and one of the following additions:
	? Multiple triangle objects.
	? Morph animated triangle objects.
To get grade A you have to implement grade B and one of the following additions:
	? Partition the mesh into a spatial data structure that is traversed in the GPU.
	? Skinned animated triangle objects.
